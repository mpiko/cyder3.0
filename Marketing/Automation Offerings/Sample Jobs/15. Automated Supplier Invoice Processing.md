**Description:**
Create an automated supplier invoice processing system that integrates email inboxes, OCR technology, and Odoo. This system will extract data from invoices, match them with purchase orders, and process payments.

**Value Provided:**
- **Efficiency Gains:** Reduces manual data entry and invoice processing time.
- **Reduced Errors:** Minimizes errors in invoice processing.
- **Cost Savings:** Streamlines invoice management and approval workflows.
