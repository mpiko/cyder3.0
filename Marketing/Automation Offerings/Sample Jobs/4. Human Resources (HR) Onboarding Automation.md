**Description:**
Implement an automated HR onboarding system that integrates job application platforms, background check services, and Odoo. This system will streamline the hiring process, from application to onboarding.

**Value Provided:**
- **Efficiency Gains:** Reduces time spent on administrative tasks during onboarding.
- **Improved Candidate Experience:** Provides a seamless and professional onboarding experience.
- **Compliance:** Ensures all onboarding steps are completed consistently and documented.

**Estimated Value:**
If the system reduces onboarding time by 5 hours per new hire and the company hires 50 employees annually, at an average HR professional's rate of $40 per hour, this saves $10,000 annually.
