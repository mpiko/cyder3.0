**Description:**
Create an automated customer support system that integrates a helpdesk (e.g., Zendesk) with Odoo. This system will route tickets, automate responses to common queries, and escalate issues as needed.

**Value Provided:**
- **Improved Response Times:** Automates responses to common queries, reducing wait times.
- **Enhanced Support Efficiency:** Frees up support staff to handle more complex issues.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Quicker resolutions lead to happier customers.

**Estimated Value:**
If the automation saves 2 hours daily for a support team of 5, at an average rate of $25 per hour, this saves $7,500 monthly, or $90,000 annually.
