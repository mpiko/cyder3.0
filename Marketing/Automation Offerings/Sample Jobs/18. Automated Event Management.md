**Description:**
Create an automated event management system that integrates event registration platforms (e.g., Eventbrite) with Odoo. This system will handle registrations, ticketing, and attendee communications.

**Value Provided:**
- **Increased Attendance:** Streamlines event registration and communication.
- **Time Savings:** Reduces manual event management efforts.
- **Improved Attendee Experience:** Provides timely updates and information.

**Estimated Value:**
If the automation increases event attendance by 10%, resulting in additional revenue of $5,000 per event, and the company hosts 4 events annually, this results in $20,000 annually.
