**Description:**
Implement an automated compliance management system that integrates compliance tools with Odoo. This system will track compliance requirements, automate audits, and generate compliance reports.

**Value Provided:**
- **Risk Reduction:** Ensures compliance with industry regulations.
- **Time Savings:** Automates compliance tracking and reporting.
- **Cost Savings:** Reduces potential fines and penalties for non-compliance.

**Estimated Value:**
If the system saves $5,000 annually in compliance costs and reduces the risk of fines worth $10,000, the total annual savings would be $15,000.
