**Description:**
Create an automated order processing system that integrates e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify, WooCommerce) with Odoo. This system will automatically handle order entries, inventory updates, invoice generation, and shipping notifications.

**Value Provided:**
- **Increased Efficiency:** Reduces manual data entry, minimizing errors and speeding up order processing.
- **Cost Savings:** Decreases the need for administrative staff, saving on labor costs.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Faster order fulfillment leads to happier customers and repeat business.

**Estimated Value:**
The business processes 1,000 orders per month, and automation saves 10 minutes per order, it saves around 167 hours monthly. Assuming an hourly rate of $30 for administrative work, this saves approximately $5,010 monthly, or $60,120 annually.
