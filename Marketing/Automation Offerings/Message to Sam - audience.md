Time is the only resource we cannot replenish and SMEs are the ones with the least of it. In my experience, I have found that SMEs also lack consistency of process. Each time they do a task, they need to stop and think about what they did last time, then try to replicate it from memory, often inconsistently, in their haste to get the job done - which obviously leads to more mistakes and more headaches. So, I suppose I am trying to describe my approach of have good recipes to follow and then ensuring that they are repeatable and automated where possible to minimise the error prone human activities. And that process and automation are a means to running an efficient business.
