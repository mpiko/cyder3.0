To express the savings as a percentage, we'll need to calculate the total potential labor cost for the 3,000 jobs if no time-saving measures were implemented. Then, we'll determine what percentage the $37,500 savings represents of that total.

### Step 1: Calculate total labor cost without time-saving measures.
- Without time savings, if each job took an additional 0.5 hours:
  - Total extra hours = 0.5 hours/job * 3,000 jobs = 1,500 hours.
  - Total labor cost without savings = 1,500 hours * $25/hour = $37,500.

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage savings.
- Since the $37,500 represents the entire amount saved due to the time reduction, it actually equates to 100% of the potential labor costs of those extra 0.5 hours per job.

Since it's the full savings from that time-saving measure, it's more impactful to keep the dollar figure directly. However, if you wanted to express it as a percentage of total labor costs for the entire operation (assuming a standard job time):

### Step 3: Estimate total labor costs for all jobs (without savings).
- Assume the standard time per job without the savings is X hours (you'd need this info to get a precise percentage).
  
If we assume, for example, that each job originally took 2 hours (before the savings), then:

- Original total labor hours = 2 hours/job * 3,000 jobs = 6,000 hours.
- Total labor cost without savings = 6,000 hours * $25/hour = $150,000.

### Step 4: Calculate the savings percentage relative to this total.
- Savings as a percentage = ($37,500 / $150,000) * 100% = **25%**.

### Refined Pitch with Percentage:
**Pitch:** **We saved The Hangmaster 25% in labor costs annually by cutting 30 minutes per job across 3,000 jobs.**

- **Expanded:** Cyder Solutions implemented an automation sequence for The Hangmaster that saved 30 minutes per job. This efficiency gain reduced their labor costs by 25%, allowing the company to save $37,500 annually, which could be reinvested in further growth and expansion.
