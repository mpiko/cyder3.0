Pitch Format: Use the format “action, deliverable, method”. For instance, “I did X for Y using Z.” however the exact order of "action, deliverable, method" is not important. 

Examples:
- We grew Company X’s revenue by _$55,000/mo in 2 months_ with an email automation system.
    
- I built a lead generation system that booked 48 qualified meetings for Company Y in 12 days _for less than $300_.
    
- We helped Company Z close an additional $1.5M in their first year with our SMS system.

Output:
The output is to be used in marketing materials and needs to be in business language with no fluff, clear, and to the point. It should contain:
- Pitch
- Single paragraph epaneded on the pitch
