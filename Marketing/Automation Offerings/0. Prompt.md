The objective is to create facebook ads which have a high conversion rate. Context: The ad will have a CTA which will use facebook forms to capture name, phone, email, and a message. Key points: The ad needs to be incredibly compelling and prompts the reader into action. The demographic and psychographic are: very small business of say 5-10 staff to Small to Medium enterprise of about 200 staff. The primary target should be the owner or director. The business should be located in Victoria Australia. The main issues facing the target are: - Tacit knowledge is everywhere in everyone's heads. - There are inconsistencies with how various staff carry out tasks. - Dependant on key people who, if they leave, would certainly disrupt the business - High turnover of staff means that the boss it constantly retraining people resulting in lost time and money. - He loves the hustle and bustle of sorting out issues, barking orders, and working IN the business. He does not have the time or energy to work ON the business. - Constantly stressed will put pressure on his health and relationships - He feels he needs to be there all the time or everything will come crashing down. He need to inspect every outgoing order to ensure it is right. He needs to be seen around the factory or the staff will bludge or do things half arsed. - Does not have the free time to develop the business any further so has subconsciously decided that this is the maximum he can scale. - Pays for a plethora of small, standalone applications which cannot be fully integrated without human intervention. Many of these apps have been requested by office staff who insist on them although he is not clear on why they are really needed. It's easier to pay than to argue. - In its current state, no-one would be interested in buying the business. There is too much work for the owner and too much reliance on key staff. The owner is sub-consciously looking for ways to become more organised. Make things run smoother. Have fewer fires to put out. The service we want to offer is an extremely low cost, high return automation which will build the confidence of the owner from the get-go.

Those suggestions would look to any owner as an expensive consulting fee service which offers a report rather than a result.
