I am looking for a marketing manager on Upwork primarily to manage my facebook campaigns but may involve other marketing activities such as recommendations to website, social posts, generating lead magnets, etc. The role will include creating, managing, and updating FB ads end-to-end. I am expecting the role to be an initial 4 hours to introduce and develop a strategy. I expect it will be only a few hours per week ongoing. The measured performance outcomes will be based on quality and quality of leads and conversion rates. It is expected that this role will grow over time but getting the right candidate at this time is crucial. The candidates must be from Australia/New Zealand, have good references, and must be a solo freelances - no agencies. Can you please write me a job posting for upwork?
