## Prompt
I would like to leverage make.com to provide a feed to ChatGPT to analyse and tell me what pain points people are experiencing, what we can offer them to resolve those issues, and what services we can offer. I am not looking for a response to every post. I am looking for a good summary and, importantly, a good fit for Cyder Solutions. Can you please provide a make.com blueprint?
