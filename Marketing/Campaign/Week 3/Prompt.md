You are a seasoned marker and copyright for Cyder Solutions and you have been tasked with creating 8 weeks of content. The following general schedule will inform on what is needed and when. Every week:
Monday
- a new blog post is to be created and uploaded to the company website 
- A post scheduled on Monday for deployment on Tuesday informing of the new blog will be posted to Facebook, Linkedin, instagram
Tuesday
- Post goes out (see Monday)
Wednesday
- Quick Tip 1
Thursday
- Quick Tip 2
Friday
- Quick Tip 2
Saturday, and Sunday
- No Posts

Note: Quick tips are simple helpful tips anyone can implement on their own. They should not be run-of-the-mill generic tips but new, fresh, quick, easy, and simple. The tips must also be relevant to the topic.

The target audience is very small to medium business owners likely to have less than 10 staff. Cyder Solutions is trying to help them along the path to automation of workflow and should be cherished as a trusted source of help in that regard. We are not looking to profit from this initial engagement but to develop a relationship so that the audience will come back and buy our services. The audience is not looking for expensive consultants who they fear will bleed them dry of cash. They are looking for people who will help them out. We need to show them that we care and the advice we give them is useful, meaningful, relevant, and save them time and money. It should not be "salesy" at all. 
Most importantly, all advice needs to be actionable. Keep the output informative yet practical, spartan, un-embellished, utilitarian. Make sure the responses are spartan in nature and don't use any frilly language.

The topics are identified in the attached schedule.

This week is week 3
Important points for this week's topic: 
- keeping and existing customer is far cheaper then acquiring a new one
- the better you know your customer the better you can serve them, the more referrals
- Good CRM tools and practices help generate leads, convert, and repeat sell
- The longer a lead has to wait for a response, the more likely you will miss out on the sale. 
- Automate the hell out of your sales process where you with a well crafted automated AI prompt no-one would ever expect was AI generated - or automated AI can assist in speeding up the response by at least a factor of 10x.

URL: https://www.cyder.com.au/blog/automation-8/the-benefits-of-automating-small-business-workflows-44

In today‚Äôs fast-paced business environment, small business owners are constantly juggling multiple tasks and responsibilities. Finding ways to streamline operations and improve efficiency is crucial. One effective strategy is automating workflows. Automation can transform how you run your business, saving you time, reducing costs, and minimising errors. In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore the benefits of workflow automation and how small businesses can start implementing it.
### Key Benefits of Workflow Automation:

**1. Time-Saving:**

Automation takes over repetitive tasks, freeing up your time to focus on more strategic activities. Whether it‚Äôs scheduling appointments, sending invoices, or managing inventory, automation can handle these tasks efficiently, allowing you to dedicate your time to growing your business.

**2. Cost Reduction:**
¬† ¬†By automating processes, you reduce the need for manual intervention, which can lower labour costs. Additionally, automation minimises errors that can lead to costly mistakes, such as incorrect data entry or missed deadlines.

**3. Error Minimisation:**
¬† ¬†Manual processes are prone to errors, especially when they involve repetitive tasks. Automation ensures consistency and accuracy, reducing the risk of mistakes that can impact your business operations.
### How Small Businesses Can Start with Simple Automation Tools:
**1. Identify Processes to Automate:**
Begin by identifying repetitive tasks that take up a significant amount of your time. Common processes include data entry, email communication, invoicing, and social media posting.¬†
**_Simple question to ask yourself: do a do this often?_**  

**2. Choose the Right Tools:**
There are numerous automation tools available that cater to different business needs. Tools like [Make.com](http://Make.com), Zapier and IFTTT allow you to connect various apps and create automated workflows without any coding knowledge. For more comprehensive solutions, consider platforms like Odoo, which offer extensive automation capabilities.
**_BUT...Don't rush out and spend money. Think about using templates or pre-built emails where you just change a few important parts._**  

**3. Start Small:**
Implementing automation doesn‚Äôt have to be overwhelming. Start with a few simple workflows and gradually expand as you become more comfortable with the tools.¬†
**_For example, you can automate email responses to common inquiries or set up automatic reminders for follow-up tasks._**

**4. Monitor and Optimise:**
Once you‚Äôve implemented automation, it‚Äôs important to monitor the results and make adjustments as needed. Regularly review your automated workflows to ensure they‚Äôre functioning correctly and delivering the desired outcomes.
**_Choose 1 small task you do frequently each week, record the time it currently takes, and then make your change. Give it a week or so, and then time it again. You'll be amazed._**  

Automation offers small businesses a powerful way to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve accuracy. By starting with simple automation tools and gradually expanding your efforts, you can transform your operations and focus on what matters most ‚Äì growing your business. Stay tuned for more tips and insights on how to leverage automation for your small business.
