Time is the only resource we cannot replenish and SMEs are the ones with the least of it. In my experience, I have found that SMEs also lack consistency of process. Each time they do a task, they need to stop and think about what they did last time, then try to replicate it from memory, often inconsistently, in their haste to get the job done - which obviously leads to more mistakes and more headaches. So, I suppose I am trying to describe my approach of have good recipes to follow and then ensuring that they are repeatable and automated where possible to minimise the error prone human activities. And that process and automation are a means to running an efficient business.

Hey Michael,  
  
I understand the importance of this project. Therefore, I've moved around some of my clients' projects today to send over the audience research and ad copy as soon as possible - approx. 9 hours ahead of schedule.  
  
Based on my extensive experience in the business automation niche, ad copy between 130-150 words works perfectly.  
  
Buyers need to be sold on emotion and logic, therefore copy in this word range is great when it comes to persuading people to take action.  
  
Also, you stand out because the Facebook ad doesn't look like millions of one or two-line ads out there!  
  
You can access the ad copy via the Google doc. link below:

I have attached a guide that identifies where each of the components provided in the ad copy is located within an ad.  
  
Attached, you will also find the audience research PDF report. If you're a Google Sheets person, you can access your report below:

I always aim to go above and beyond for my clients. Therefore, to make your life easier, I've recorded a quick video to talk you through how to set up an audience within your ads manager.

For your reference, I've also attached a screenshot showing how audience 1 would be built on an ad set level within your Facebook ads manager.  
  
Please send me a message if you have any questions. I am here to help.  
  
Thank you, and have a great day,
