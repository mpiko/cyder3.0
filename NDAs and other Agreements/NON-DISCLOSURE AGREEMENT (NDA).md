### 1. Definition of Confidential Information

For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all information, whether written or oral, disclosed by the Company to the Sub-Contractor, directly or indirectly, that is designated as confidential, proprietary, or that can reasonably be deemed to be confidential or proprietary given the nature of the information and the context of its disclosure.

The Sub-Contractor agrees to:

a. **Use of Confidential Information:** Use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing work on the Company's projects and not for any other purpose.

b. **Non-Disclosure:** Not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Company, except as required by law or as necessary to perform work on the Company's projects, provided that the third party is bound by confidentiality obligations similar to those contained in this Agreement.

c. **Protection:** Protect the Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.

d. **Return or Destruction:** Upon termination of this Agreement or upon request by the Company, promptly return or destroy all materials containing Confidential Information, including any copies or derivatives thereof, and certify in writing that it has complied with this obligation.

b. **Already Known:** Was known to the Sub-Contractor prior to the disclosure by the Company, as evidenced by the Sub-Contractor's written records;

c. **Received from Third Party:** Is received from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality;

d. **Independently Developed:** Is independently developed by the Sub-Contractor without the use of or reference to the Company's Confidential Information, as evidenced by the Sub-Contractor's written records.

### 4. Ownership of Intellectual Property

All intellectual property, including but not limited to, inventions, designs, processes, software, and any other work products created by the Sub-Contractor as part of the engagement with the Company, shall be the exclusive property of Cyder Solutions. The Sub-Contractor agrees to assign and hereby assigns all rights, title, and interest in such intellectual property to Cyder Solutions. The Sub-Contractor further agrees to execute any documents necessary to effectuate such assignment.

### 5. Term

This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement no longer qualifies as confidential, or until terminated by either party with thirty (30) days' written notice.

### 6. No License

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information or to any invention or patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right that has been disclosed under this Agreement.

### 7. Remedies

The Sub-Contractor acknowledges that any unauthorised use or disclosure of the Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm to the Company for which monetary damages may not be sufficient. Accordingly, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and any other remedies available at law or in equity in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

### 8. Miscellaneous

a. **Governing Law:** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Victoria, Australia, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

c. **Amendments:** This Agreement may only be amended in writing signed by both parties.

d. **Severability:** If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

e. **Waiver:** The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
