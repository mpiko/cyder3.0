**WHEREAS, Cyder Solutions ("Consultant") agrees to provide remote support services to [Client Name] ("Client") as set forth in this Agreement, and the Client agrees to retain the Consultant's services on the terms and conditions herein contained.**

**NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:**

### 1. Scope of Services

Consultant agrees to provide the Client with remote support services for a minimum of four (4) hours per month ("Included Hours"). Services will be provided by qualified personnel of the Consultant. Time is booked in 15-minute increments, with sub-2-minute interactions not being significant and therefore not booked.

### 2. Retainer Fee and Reimbursable Expenses

a. **Monthly Retainer Fee:** The Client agrees to pay the Consultant a monthly retainer fee of $360.00 AUD for the Included Hours. This fee is payable in advance on the first day of each month.

b. **Additional Hours:** If the actual time spent providing remote support services exceeds six (6) hours in any given month, the Consultant will charge the Client $100.00 AUD per hour for each additional hour beyond the initial four (4) hours.

c. **On-Site Support:** On-site support visits are not included in this Agreement and will be charged separately at the Consultant's standard rates.

d. **Additional Costs:** Any additional costs incurred during any related support activities will be passed on to the Client.

e. **Billing:** The Consultant will track and invoice the Client for any additional hours, on-site support, and additional costs at the end of each month. Payment is due within fourteen (14) days of the invoice date.

f. **Timesheets:** Timesheets will be viewable by the Client at any time via the online portal.

### 3. Relationship of Parties

The Consultant is an independent contractor and not an employee of the Client. This Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, or any other similar relationship between the parties. Each party is responsible for their own tax and legal liabilities.

### 4. Term and Termination

a. **Initial Term:** This Agreement shall commence on [Effective Date] and shall continue for a period of twelve (12) months ("Initial Term").

b. **Renewal:** Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms unless either party provides written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.

c. **Termination for Cause:** Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other party breaches any material term or condition of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach from the non-breaching party.

### 5. Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration, as mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties cannot agree on a method of dispute resolution, the dispute shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (ACICA).

### 6. Ownership of Work

Cyder Solutions retains ownership of all rights to any digital assets or customised solutions created or provided during the term of this Agreement. The Client is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use these assets and solutions for their internal purposes only.

### 7. Confidentiality

The Consultant agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained during the term of this Agreement. This confidentiality obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

### 8. Limitation of Liability

Cyder Solutions provides advice and recommendations to the Client but takes no responsibility for the use or execution of said advice. In no event shall either party be liable to the other for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. The Consultant's total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the total amount of fees paid by the Client to the Consultant during the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

### 9. Miscellaneous

a. **Governing Law:** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of [State], Australia, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

b. **Entire Agreement:** This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, representations, and understandings of the parties, whether written or oral.

c. **Amendments:** This Agreement may only be amended in writing signed by both parties.

d. **Severability:** If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

e. **Waiver:** The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

f. **Fee Adjustments:** Outside of this Agreement, Cyder Solutions reserves the right to adjust its fees at any time.
