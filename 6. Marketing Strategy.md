What must our business be in the minds of our customers in order for them to choose us over everyone else?

Your marketing strategy starts, ends, lives, and dies with your customer. **Nothing else matters**.

Decisions are made in the customers mind unconsciously

Find a *perceived* need and fill it.

Unless you understand
- What needs to be done
- The essential importance of marketing your prototype

- Your prototype **is** your product
All the "how to do it" will not mean a thing.
