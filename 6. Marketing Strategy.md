### Outsourcing Marketing Thoughts
Paying a fee based on lead generation will produce quantity with low quality
- Needs to be extremely cheap per lead!
Paying a fee based on sales will produce low quantity with high quality. 
- Can be priced proportionally to the value of the sale.
In either case, the engagement should be no longer than 6 months during which the process will be replicated internally. From that time onwards, all marketing will be in-sourced.
