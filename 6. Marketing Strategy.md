*Quote: What must our business be in the minds of our customers in order for them to choose us over everyone else. Your marketing strategy and business starts, ends, lives, and dies with your customer. **Nothing else matters**.*
# Customer Profile
### Segment
**Customer:** Small Business Owners
**Demographics:** Typically male over 30

### Utopia
Have the business run without them. Total financial independence. Take holidays whenever they want to wherever they want not matter the cost in time or money.
Can be involved in the business as much or as little as they want. 
### Obstacles
- Tacit knowledge is everywhere in everyone's heads.
- There are inconsistencies with how various staff carry out tasks.
- Dependant on key people who, if they leave, would certainly disrupt the business
- High turnover of staff means that the boss it constantly retraining people resulting in lost time and money.
- He loves the hustle and bustle of sorting out issues, barking orders, and working IN the business. He does not have the time or energy to work ON the business.
- Constantly stressed will put pressure on his health and relationships
- He feels he needs to be there all the time or everything will come crashing down. He need to inspect every outgoing order to ensure it is right. He needs to be seen around the factory or the staff will bludge or do things half arsed.
- Does not have the free time to develop the business any further so has subconsciously decided that this is the maximum he can scale.
- Pays for a plethora of small, standalone applications which cannot be fully integrated without human intervention. Many of these apps have been requested by office staff who insist on them although he is not clear on why they are really needed. It's easier to pay than to argue.
- In its current state, no-one would be interested in buying the business. There is too much work for the owner and too much reliance on key staff.

- I've always been skeptical about buying mail lists.

### Lead to Conversions
Entice the target prospect, a small business owner, through offering small automation and build trust. Small, easy to do, modest profit, charge just enough to cover expenses and a bit of buffer. Then, when we have rapport and trust, we can up-sell them on more lucrative offerings.
Small automation:
- Use Make.com or IFTTT to connect their Facebook Ads to their google sheets or CRM software.
- Possibly some analysis involving AI of leads or opportunities
- Possibly see our weekly tips and blog posts for ideas.

### Budget
Fund are extremely tight at the moment.

### Outsourcing Marketing Thoughts
Paying a fee based on lead generation will produce quantity with low quality
- Needs to be extremely cheap per lead!
Paying a fee based on sales will produce low quantity with high quality. 
- Can be priced proportionally to the value of the sale.
In either case, the engagement should be no longer than 6 months during which the process will be replicated internally. From that time onwards, all marketing will be in-sourced.

## Practice
#### Identification
Specifically, who are your current or potential customers?
What is their profile
- Demographic 
- Psychographic
- Geographic
What other brands or products do they buy and why are they appealing? What traits do they look for in a product they have purchased in the past? Consider what selling methods are already appealing to them?
