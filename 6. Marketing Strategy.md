What must our business be in the minds of our customers in order for them to choose us over everyone else. Your marketing strategy starts, ends, lives, and dies with your customer. **Nothing else matters**.
# Customer Profile

### Utopia
Have the business run without them. Total financial independence. Take holidays whenever they want to wherever they want not matter the cost in time or money.
Can be involved in the business as much or as little as they want. 
### Obstacles
- Tacit knowledge is everywhere in everyone's heads.
- There are inconsistencies with how various staff carry out tasks.
- Dependant on key people who, if they leave, would certainly disrupt the business
- High turnover of staff means that the boss it constantly retraining people resulting in lost time and money.
- He feels he needs to be there all the time or everything will come crashing down. He need to inspect every outgoing order to ensure it is right. He needs to be seen around the factory or the staff will bludge or do things half arsed.
- Does not have the free time to develop the business any further so has subconsciously decided that this is the maximum he can scale.
- Pays for a plethora of small, standalone applications which cannot be fully integrated without human intervention. Many of these apps have been requested by office staff who insist on them although he is not clear on why they are really needed. It's easier to pay than to argue.
- In its current state, no-one would be interested in buying the business. There is too much work for the owner and too much reliance on key staff.

### Outsourcing Marketing Thoughts
Paying a fee based on lead generation will produce quantity with low quality
- Needs to be extremely cheap per lead!
Paying a fee based on sales will produce low quantity with high quality. 
- Can be priced proportionally to the value of the sale.
In either case, the engagement should be no longer than 6 months during which the process will be replicated internally. From that time onwards, all marketing will be in-sourced.

Specifically, who are your current or potential customers?
What is their profile

What other brands or products do they buy and why are they appealing? What traits do they look for in a product they have purchased in the past? Consider what selling methods are already appealing to them?
