What must our business be in the minds of our customers in order for them to choose us over everyone else?

Your marketing strategy starts, ends, lives, and dies with your customer. **Nothing else matters**.

Decisions are made in the customers mind unconsciously

### Two Pillars of a Successful Marketing Strategy
1. Demographics 
	- who your customer is
2. Psychographics 
	- why your customer buys
	- Your customer's perceived reality
Then create a prototype to satisfy your customers unconscious needs
