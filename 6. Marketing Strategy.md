## Theory
What must our business be in the minds of our customers in order for them to choose us over everyone else?

Your marketing strategy starts, ends, lives, and dies with your customer. **Nothing else matters**.

Decisions are made in the customers mind unconsciously

Find a *perceived* need and fill it.

Unless you understand
- What needs to be done
- The essential importance of marketing your prototype
- Your customer is far less rational in their decision making
- Your prototype **is** your product
All the **"how to do it"** will not mean a thing. 

==TODO==
Refine this definition of product
Product (service?) is the way your business operates
Your business sells commodity products
### Two Pillars of a Successful Marketing Strategy
1. Demographics 
	- Who your customer is
2. Psychographics 
	- why your customer buys
	- Your customer's perceived reality
Then create a prototype product to satisfy your customers unconscious needs
### Inquiry
The act of solicitation of specific information and controlled experimentation 
- Innovation
- Quantification
- Orchestration
---
## Practice
#### Identification
Specifically, who are your current or potential customers?
What is their demographic profile?
