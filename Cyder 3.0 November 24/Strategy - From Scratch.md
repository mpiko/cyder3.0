Ah, I understand - you're starting from scratch. Let's create a more practical strategy that doesn't rely on existing materials:

1. Initial Content Creation (No Testimonials Needed):

Educational Content:
- Share industry insights about common equipment management challenges
- Break down different ERP/FSM solutions available in the market
- Post about industry trends and statistics (which you can source from public reports)
- Share "how-to" content about basic business process improvement

Example Posts:
```
"Did you know? Equipment rental businesses typically spend 5-7 hours per week just on scheduling maintenance. Here's how automation can cut that down to minutes... [Explain basic concept]"

"Quick Tip: 3 Warning Signs Your Equipment Management System Needs an Upgrade:
1. You're using multiple spreadsheets
2. Field staff are calling office for equipment info
3. You can't get real-time utilization reports"
```

2. LinkedIn Growth Strategy (No Case Studies Required):

Phase 1: Network Building (First 30 Days)
- Connect with 10 people daily using this template:
```
"Hi [Name], I'm building a network of equipment rental and service professionals in Australia. Would love to connect and share insights about industry automation trends."
```

Phase 3: Engagement Building (While Creating Case Studies)
1. Ask Questions in Posts:
```
"Equipment service managers: What's your biggest challenge with scheduling preventive maintenance? Comment below ðŸ‘‡"

"Quick poll: How many different software systems do you use to manage your equipment rental business?"
```

2. Share Process Insights:
```
"Here's a simple process map for equipment handover that we've seen work well:
1. Digital checklist
2. Photo documentation
3. Real-time updates
4. Automated notifications

What would you add to this list?"
```

3. Initial Lead Generation (No Social Proof Required):

Focus on Problem-Based Outreach:
```
"Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] provides equipment [rental/service] in [location]. 

I'm curious - how are you currently handling maintenance scheduling and field service management? 

I'd love to learn about your process and share some insights about how other businesses are automating these tasks.

Would you be open to a quick chat?"
```

4. Quick Wins to Build Case Studies:

To build your first case studies:
1. Offer a free process audit to 5 businesses
2. Document their current challenges in detail
3. Implement a small, quick-win solution
4. Ask to document the improvement

5. Alternative Social Proof:

Instead of case studies, use:
- Before/after process diagrams
- Sample workflow automations
- ROI calculators
- Free process assessment tools

6. Action Plan for Next 30 Days:

Week 1:
- Create your LinkedIn company page
- Write 5 educational posts about common industry problems
- Connect with 50 target prospects

Week 2:
- Share 3 process improvement tips

Would you like me to expand on any of these areas or provide specific examples of posts you could create right away?

The key is to position yourself as a knowledgeable advisor who understands the industry's challenges, rather than relying on past success stories. Focus on educating your market and demonstrating your expertise through practical insights and solutions.
