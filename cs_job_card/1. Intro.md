Scenario
- Too many Odoo accounts needed for FS or other internally focused apps such as Maintenance, Projects, Repairs, etc.

- In Australia, we call Tradespeople Tradies.
	- Don't want to pay for tradies. 
	- May have 200 tradies you use. Some of them rarely, some often
	- Tradies service regions 

Look around
- Contacts
	- list view, open customer 1, then open Tradie 1
- Job Card
