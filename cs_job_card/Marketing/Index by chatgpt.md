you are a senior marketing expert and have been tasked with creating a web landing page for a new Odoo application. The application is targeted towards companies who provide services to residential and commerial clients. The target customer will typically bring in work, quote on it, then hire a tradesman to go out and do the work, inspect the complleted works, and finally charge the end client. The company will not need to do any of the actual field work themselves but will supply parts. The tradesmen who do the work have a portal they can log on and update the job cards, see all the job details such as site contacts, site addresses, and so fourth. The company will send requests for quotation to the tradesmen for them to bid on the work.

Can you please write a attractive promotional index.html using embedded bootstrap css as both a landing page on the website but also as a page on the Odoo App store?
