### Utopia
Have the business run without them. Total financial independence. Take holidays whenever they want to wherever they want not matter the cost in time or money.
Can be involved in the business as much or as little as they want. 
### Obstacles
- Tacit knowledge is everywhere in everyone's heads.
- There are inconsistencies with how various staff carry out tasks.
- Dependant on key people who, if they leave, would certainly disrupt the business
- High turnover of staff means that the boss it constantly retraining people resulting in lost time and money.
- He loves the hustle and bustle of sorting out issues, barking orders, and working IN the business. He does not have the time or energy to work ON the business.
- Constantly stressed will put pressure on his health and relationships
- He feels he needs to be there all the time or everything will come crashing down. He need to inspect every outgoing order to ensure it is right. He needs to be seen around the factory or the staff will bludge or do things half arsed.
- Does not have the free time to develop the business any further so has subconsciously decided that this is the maximum he can scale.
- Pays for a plethora of small, standalone applications which cannot be fully integrated without human intervention. Many of these apps have been requested by office staff who insist on them although he is not clear on why they are really needed. It's easier to pay than to argue.
- In its current state, no-one would be interested in buying the business. There is too much work for the owner and too much reliance on key staff.
