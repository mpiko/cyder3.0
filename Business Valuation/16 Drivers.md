The 16 drivers mentioned in the presentation are factors that influence a business's revenue, profit, and cash flow. These drivers are essential for understanding and improving a business's overall health and value. Here's an expanded overview of each:

### **Revenue Drivers:**
1. **Leads:** 
   - The number of potential customers who show interest in your product or service. Increasing the number of leads is crucial because it represents the starting point for generating sales. Effective marketing and sales strategies are key to driving more leads.

2. **Conversion Rate:**
   - The percentage of leads that become paying customers. Improving the conversion rate often involves refining sales processes, enhancing customer experiences, and ensuring that sales teams are well-trained.

3. **Retention Rate:**
   - The percentage of customers who continue to do business with you over time. High retention indicates satisfied customers who find value in your offerings. Loyalty programs, exceptional customer service, and regular engagement can help improve retention.

4. **Purchase Frequency Rate:**
   - The average number of times a customer purchases from your business within a specific period (e.g., annually). Encouraging repeat business through promotions, subscriptions, or upselling can increase purchase frequency.

5. **Average Transaction Value:**
   - The average amount of money a customer spends per transaction. Raising this metric involves techniques such as cross-selling, upselling, or bundling products/services.

### **Profit Drivers:**
6. **Revenue:**
   - Total income generated from selling products or services. This is a key driver of profit as it directly influences how much money is available after covering costs.

7. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
   - The direct costs of producing goods or services sold by the business (e.g., materials, labor). Reducing COGS without sacrificing quality can improve profit margins.

8. **Marketing Expenses:**
   - The costs associated with promoting and selling your products or services. Efficient allocation of marketing resources to high-performing channels can reduce costs and increase profit margins.

9. **Payroll Expenses:**
   - The costs of salaries, wages, and benefits paid to employees. Optimizing workforce efficiency and managing payroll expenses relative to revenue is essential for profitability.

10. **Overhead Expenses:**
   - The ongoing costs of running the business, such as rent, utilities, insurance, and administrative costs. Reducing overhead by cutting unnecessary expenses or negotiating better deals with suppliers can enhance profit margins.

11. **Other Income:**
   - Income that is not directly related to the core business activities, such as rental income, interest, or royalties. Identifying and maximizing other income sources can contribute to overall profitability.

12. **Other Expenses:**
   - Non-core business expenses that can impact profitability, such as fines, penalties, or non-operating costs. Controlling these expenses helps maintain healthy profit margins.

### **Cash Flow Drivers:**
13. **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):**
   - The average number of days it takes to receive payment from customers after a sale is made. Reducing DSO improves cash flow by accelerating the collection of receivables.

14. **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO):**
   - The average number of days inventory is held before it is sold. Lowering DIO helps free up cash tied in inventory, allowing for reinvestment elsewhere in the business.

15. **Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):**
   - The average number of days it takes to pay suppliers. Extending DPO without harming supplier relationships can help retain cash in the business for a longer period.

16. **Owner or Investment Draws:**
   - The amount of money taken out of the business by the owner(s) or investors. Balancing withdrawals with the businessâ€™s cash flow needs ensures sufficient capital remains for operations and growth.

### **How These Drivers Work Together:**
By understanding and optimizing these 16 drivers, a business can effectively increase its revenue, reduce its costs, and improve its cash flow. Here are a few ways they interact:
- **Increase Revenue:** Focus on increasing leads, improving conversion rates, retaining customers, and maximizing transaction values.
- **Improve Profit Margins:** Manage COGS, marketing, payroll, and overhead expenses effectively.
- **Enhance Cash Flow:** Optimize cash collection (DSO), manage inventory levels (DIO), and extend payment terms (DPO) strategically.

### **Using the Drivers to Build a Valuable Business:**
To build a valuable, sellable business, you should track and measure these drivers regularly, identify areas for improvement, and implement targeted actions to enhance each area. By doing so, you create a business that is more profitable, less dependent on the owner, and better positioned for growth and sale.
