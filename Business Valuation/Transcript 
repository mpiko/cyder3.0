0:05
welcome everyone so whilst we're waiting um if you want to just put a comment in the chat let us know uh where you're
0:11
from and what type of business you run just to get an idea of who we've got here we'll just give it a couple of minutes uh whilst whilst we let people
0:18
join and so just to say up front as well this is our first time using this platform so uh we think it's all going
0:24
to run smoothly but just if we have any technical difficulties then apologies in advance
0:44
all right so um let's get started so the theme of today's session is how to build a valuable sellable business so that's
0:51
what we've got um so the way we're going to address that question is by hitting the points that we've got here on on
0:57
this agenda so firstly some context why most businesses don't sell I they
1:02
fail to sell people that try and sell them business owners try and sell them fail to sell them and then we'll do a
1:08
deep dive into how business valuations actually work so give you a foundation of kind of what uh what drives business
1:14
valuation and then finally with that understanding what do you need to do about it to actually start making a
1:20
difference and building a valuable sellable business yourself and then not only that but also how to avoid failure
1:26
which at the moment stands at about 50% so 50% of businesses don't make it to their fifth birthday um and the way that
1:31
we're going to show you how to kind of address building a valuable sellable business would also naturally help you
1:37
um address the failure issue as well um and so what I also want to highlight here is that even if you're at the very
1:43
beginning of your business journey and you don't know whether you want to sell or you think that selling might be 10 15
1:48
years away um the best way to build the business is the same in any case so if
1:53
you can build a profitable efficient and well-run business that runs like a machine the chance are it's going to be
2:00
more sellable and more valuable and it'll also be much easier to run yourself which will make it more enjoyable and less stressful and you'll
2:07
then have a choice about whether you sell a business which is a much more desirable position to be in than getting
2:12
10 years down the line and realizing that you built a business that causes you endless amounts of stress and and no
2:17
one wants to buy anyway um so I'll give you a little bit of an introduction by
2:22
the way housekeeping first so we'll be here for about 45 minutes probably about half an hour of Graeme and I talking and
2:28
then around 15 minutes of Q&A any questions you've got just put them in the chat and we'll get to them um so
2:36
this is me Tom graffis um I spent about 10 years in what I've been in finance for about 10 years seven of which were
2:42
in Investment Banking and asset management at at JB Morgan and in the last three I've spent helping small
2:49
business owners um on a variety of different things but um specifically over the last few years focused on
2:56
helping business owners keep their business healthy improve profits in cash flow and then increase the value of
3:02
their business and I'm on a mission to help as many of those businesses as I can over the course of my career don't
3:07
know how many years that'll be but hopefully quite a lot um so that's an intro to me I I'll hand over to Graeme
3:12
who will introduce himself and then go into the first point that I mentioned around the context and then driving the
3:18
what drives business valuations so over to you grahe great thanks Tom um and as
3:24
as as some of you all yeah by the accent I'm based in Cape Town um and Tom and I
3:29
have connected Ed you know over LinkedIn probably what six nine months ago Tom and and done quite a bit of work
3:35
together um and Tom's actually going to be out in cap town to attend a wedding and hopefully play some golf in the next
3:40
couple of weeks so we we actually really looking forward to connecting in person and and having a nice glass of wine and
3:47
a round of golf hopefully um but as you know my name is Graham um I'm a chared accountant by training and but I've
3:54
spent you know the last 20 years in various roles in banking but probably the last five or six has really been
4:00
entrenched in the sort of Entrepreneurship space from having my own consultancy to founding bville a
4:06
couple of years ago in the last two years we've valued over four and a half thousand private companies and you know
4:13
Bisal is all about empowering entrepreneurs to make better decisions around their business help them
4:19
understand the value and help them unlock that value so I tell the story often is is is my dad was I wouldn't say
4:25
a failed entrepreneur but he was a solar preneur who who at 74 years years old is still climbing ladders and doing stuff
4:32
to make a living and I you know don't want other entrepreneurs to fall into
4:38
that trap so we about helping you build a business of value so that you can
4:43
retire in the south of Spain in a nice Villa rather than a small flat in the middle of leads um so that's that's a
4:51
bit about me I think today we're going to talk a bit I'm going to talk a bit about the valuation fundamentals and
4:58
then I'm going to hand over to to talk through the principles on how to build
5:03
that business of value so there's going to be a little bit of overlap between the two of us but I think we'll come together quite nicely and please feel
5:09
free to put your comments in the questions or your your questions in the comments and um you know there's no
5:17
question too hard or too difficult if we can't answer it yeah we can always take it offline but um please feel free to to
5:23
add in the comments so I think let's just start with some background is the reality is this and it's not scar
5:29
tactics but 80 to 90% of private businesses don't sell um
5:36
they end up being wound down and that's a scary stat because I think most
5:42
business owners have this dream of selling their business one day to fund their retirement or fund their lifestyle
5:48
so that's that's a really problematic stat and I think there's three main reasons for that the first one is sounds
5:56
pretty obvious um the business actually doesn't make enough money to justify the
6:02
valuation that the owner wants so we talk about the sort of expectation Gap
6:07
is many business owners have an idea of what they want their business to be worth and what it entails for them to
6:13
live the life they want post exit but the reality is that often the business doesn't back that up a buyer of a
6:21
business looks at it through the lens of an investor and that's that's the most important thing if the business isn't
6:26
making enough money it's not going to be valuable to a potential buyer yes there
6:33
are things like strategic buyers and all of that but but hoping to get a strategic exit for the most part is like
6:39
hoping to win the Lotter um it happens far less often than than most business
6:44
owners like to believe the second is tied to that but
6:50
you know we've got some stats on this but something like 65% of businesses that we've worked with in the last two
6:57
years have got a high degree of owner dependence and what that means is that the business doesn't operate
7:04
independently and separate of the owner so when the owner goes on leave the business slows down when the owner stops
7:09
working so that's the second big reason why businesses don't sell or certainly
7:15
don't sell at a value which is um which is enough and then the third most
7:21
important point is that the business was not adequately prepared for sale and
7:27
this has got a range of different um things yeah seems to be we're having some issues on on LinkedIn um I I'll
7:34
carry on and and hopefully send out the recording if there's a if there's a couple of LinkedIn issues um but the
7:41
yeah the third point was around not being adequately prepared for sale so that means your accounting records and
7:46
we'll touch on some of those things now but you know think about going out on a date you need to make sure that you are
7:53
ready for that date um you know if you rock up in smelly clothes and what have you it's not a very high chance that
7:58
you're going to get a second date uh in fact you might even have a walk out on that date if you don't take the effort to get prepared so what we're going to
8:06
do is talk a little bit about what it really takes to create a valuable and
8:12
sellable business I'm going to Breeze through a couple of these slides why are
8:18
valuations important raising Equity selling a company managing growth I'm not going to dwell on this but the first
8:25
point is you need to understand what your business is worth and besides being being you know having a value for sale
8:31
there's a bunch of other reasons why you might want valuation the point I want to make about this is a lot of business owners say I'm not thinking about
8:38
selling now why do I need evaluation even if that is your departure point
8:44
there's a bunch of other reasons why you might need to have valuation done whether that's preparing for life insurance taking care of your family
8:51
potential shareholder disputes so we we kind of see valuation as a starting point to kind of map out the future and
8:57
the road map in terms of where you want to go there's a misconception around
9:03
valuation and I'll touch on this just now but at the end of the day when an
9:08
investor looks at a business evaluation is quite simple you know we can get quite technical about
9:15
this and throw out words that investment bankers and everyone uses but it's really about a summation of your future
9:22
cash flows how much cash profit are you making now and how much cash profit are
9:28
you going to be making into the future and what are the risks and the likelihood of that happening and
9:35
obviously factored into that is growth so if you've got high growth expectations the business is worth more
9:41
so it's a function of cash profits growth certainty around those profits
9:46
and putting an investor lens on what the risk appetite of that investor might be
9:52
so certain investors might have a higher risk tolerance than others and that's why sometimes different buyers might
9:59
place a different value in the business because they have different different expectations around um around the
10:06
investment return you know we talk about valuation being a combination of craft and science it's primarily science but
10:14
you also need to be aware of what's happening in the market you know
10:19
sometimes you might not achieve the valuation that your business inherently worth because it's a bad time you know
10:24
if you're at the bottom of the cycle it might not be a good time to sell your business but the point is it doesn't
10:31
mean that you shouldn't focus on the fundamentals and make sure that you have the optionality and be ready to sell at
10:37
any point in time so I'm going to talk for about another five minutes I'm going to talk
10:43
about the five key pillars of building a business of value and then a couple of
10:48
the value drivers and detractors and hand over to Tom so I've spoken about this already owner Independence I can't
10:56
stress this enough you know as entrepreneurs you know we passionate we're energetic
11:01
we want to build we want to be involved in the business but we become the new surround our own next often as
11:08
entrepreneurs and when you're building a business I think it's about a mindset from day one where you keep asking
11:14
yourself is how do I make myself redundant how do I make sure that this
11:20
business can operate without me and sometimes it's hard sometimes you know
11:25
it's harder to train somebody to do something that you're doing you know can do it in five minutes it's going to take me five days to train somebody but if
11:33
you don't do that you get stuck so I think that's the first point I want to just kind of
11:40
emphasize the second one and it's linked to this is around building effective and
11:45
scalable processes and systems and one of my one of my business mentors always
11:53
said to me you're more likely to suffer from indigestion when your business scales um and that's such app point
11:59
because as the business grows have you got the systems and processes that can handle that scale and
12:06
a lot of businesses fall short so you know things like CRM systems a lot of
12:13
business owners say well why do I need that you know I can do it off Excel or I can do it off um you know I can do it
12:18
off Outlook at the end of the day when a business grows you need to have those systems in places and whether they are
12:24
technology Le systems whether they people Le that's what enables the owner
12:29
to take a step away from the business the third point and Tom is
12:37
going to talk about this in a little bit more detail but is around strong unit economics and strong unit economics is
12:45
does the business actually make money okay are you able to at a unit level
12:52
make a profit margin on everything that you're selling and if you don't have this you don't
12:58
have a business you have a charity um and that's not just on paper but it's actually how does that unit economic
13:05
convert into Cash the fourth point is around really
13:11
understanding your customer so what pain Point are you solving for them and how do you get that customer to keep coming
13:17
back referring you and reusing you over time so it's often we talk about
13:22
customer lifetime value and for business owners some of these things are really practical things you know what does your
13:28
Google review stay you know if you're in the hospitality industry what is your uh you know what is your booking.com rating
13:35
you know so understanding what your customer needs are what their wants are and actually tracking and measuring that
13:41
is really really critical and then the last point is around is the market big enough to
13:47
actually achieve the value that you want so some people have great businesses but they're just small businesses okay and
13:55
unfortunately if your Market is too small you're never going to be able to ex ract a huge valuation out of that
14:01
business I just want to pause quickly I know we seem to be having some technical issues on LinkedIn and um you know we
14:08
have tested this beforehand so apologies to anyone on LinkedIn struggling um the recording will be made available
14:15
afterwards um but it's it's one of those glitches which unfortunately we can't do
14:20
anything about right now so the last point I want to talk about
14:26
is you know just about different ways of valuing a business business so I say beware the revenue multiple or beware
14:33
the multiple and just from a fundamental understanding point of view a lot of people have the view that a business is
14:38
worth four times their ebit or four times their revenues or five times their
14:44
revenues now whilst in practice people use multiples to talk about value and
14:50
comparing different business of value a multiple is what we call an output based
14:56
measure yeah saying my neighbor's business sold for five times multiples
15:03
therefore mine must also sell for five times multiple I use this analogy all the time I say it's a bit like putting
15:09
five six' three 200 men in a row and say they're all going to play front row for
15:14
the England rugby team okay um that's not the case so when you look at
15:20
businesses multiples are useful but use them as a sanity check rather than as
15:26
you know the gospel when it comes to understanding the value of the business business Tom I'm going to take a pause
15:31
here I don't know if you want to add anything before I kind of wrap off with some of the drivers and tractors of value and then I'm GNA hand over to you
15:38
but I know if you want to just add anything before I do a quick wrap up no I'm gonna I'm gonna feed off what you
15:44
say next which is the these ones um value drivers and detractors and just just for anyone who's on LinkedIn um I
15:51
understand it's a bit slow at the moment if you want to join via the streamyard link um then that that should work so
15:56
join via the streamyard link and all will be fine cool so yeah when we talk about value
16:03
drivers and detractors you know the positives are things like strong growth rate cash conversion we've spoken about
16:10
and Tom's going to dive into a bit of detail around that you know I want to use another one like I and Trade Secrets
16:16
these are things which smaller business owners often forget about but it could be something as simple as owning your
16:23
your web domain okay uh when you start a business you don't think about going and getting a trademark protection on your
16:29
business necessarily but these things are important if your business scales and it grows I've seen too many horror
16:35
stories of domains being hijacked and you know trademark being stolen from
16:40
under the foot of a successful business because that stuff wasn't done up front so those things are important uh
16:46
recurring Revenue Tom will talk about that so you know sort of secret source and we talk about software Services
16:52
businesses it's always about how do you get that recurring Revenue you know all things else being equal you want
16:58
customers coming back and that's why recurring revenue is so so important and then things like Geographic footprint
17:05
you know so you know are you just in your local suburb are you National or
17:11
are you Global so geographically distributed businesses can often have a lot more value because you're touching
17:17
on different markets and you know you you've got more diversification in your business on the other side you've got
17:23
the negatives so owner dependence again is probably the single biggest factor that we worry about uh poor quality
17:31
financial information whilst it doesn't necessarily increase the value it's one
17:36
of the first things an investor will look like look at they'll say show me your financial records are they audited
17:43
and do they make sense you know a lot of business owners will then pull out a second set of records and say well
17:49
here's my tax man accounts and here's my my real accounts in practice guys that's a red flag um and you're going to find
17:57
it very difficult to sell your business if you are taking shortcuts on the accounting side and then things like
18:04
customer dependency you know so have you got one big customer that if they cancel your contract your business goes under
18:10
so investors will look at how Diversified is your customer base how resilient is that to changes in the
18:17
market and all those things so those are kind kind of some of the key factors that I want to focus on I'm going to
18:23
hand over to Tom now who's going to dive a little bit deeper into you know what are the key components of creating you
18:30
know that profitability and then his recipe for actually making that happen over time Tom over to you cheers Graeme
18:38
right so with that understanding of how business valuation works and that clear
18:43
picture Graeme has just painted for us in terms of what drives and detracts from business value hopefully you can
18:50
see that what we really need to try and create here is a business that pretty much runs on its own and doesn't carry
18:55
too much risk and and like I said at the beginning if you can create that that business is going to be much easier for
19:01
you to run anyway and it's going to be a lot less stressful and you can then have the choice about whether you sell it um
19:06
so how do we create that well we can improve all of those factors that Graeme
19:12
has just highlighted on on the previous slide and in fact everything he's talked about before that using cash or excess
19:17
cash in the business so cash solves every problem that we have or or can ever have in a business so if the
19:24
business is dependent on the owner cash will allow us to hire hire a management team and delegate um if we have over
19:31
dependency on one or two large customers cash would allow us to invest in marketing to diversify um if we have a
19:39
messy Finance function and the finances don't paint a a clear picture of what's going on or there are you know dodgy
19:44
things going on um cash would allow us to invest in the finance function and fix all of all of that things and the list is pretty much endless in terms of
19:50
what we can do with cash but the point is that cash solves every problem that we're going to face in business um so if
19:56
we know that we need cash how do we find that cash so that we can um allocate it
20:01
to the right places and solve these problems that we have so the place that we want to find it is from the business
20:07
um we can borrow money and we can get the owner to invest money but really we want to we want to raise money through the business and what happens when we uh
20:15
have a business that produces more cash if you remember from what Graham said previously the number one driver of business value is the cash flow and the
20:22
profits that it generates so if we can focus on improving the cash profits of the business um our business value is
20:29
going to increase um and we can also use the excess cash flow and profits to reinvest into those risk areas that gra
20:37
highlighted on the previous slide and then um increase the business value with it um so how do we how do we do that how
20:44
do we build a a business that um produces lots of cash so essentially the
20:50
way I like to think of it is you need to think of your business as a machine a money-making machine so what do we mean
20:56
by that well let's use the example of a washing machine okay its purpose is to wash clothes and it's made up of
21:02
multiple different parts and if it fails at doing what it's supposed to do which is wash clothes then there's a reason why so if you find that reason and you
21:09
fix it then the machine's going to go back to doing what it's supposed to do okay so it's exactly the same with the business we should think of our
21:16
businesses as machines and the purpose of these machines uh is that they make money um they're all made up of the same
21:22
Parts the same 16 Parts I'm about to run through and if if our machine fails at doing what it's supposed to do which is
21:28
money then there is a reason why so if we're having profitability issues we're not making much money or not making as
21:33
much money as we want to or cash flow problems then there's a reason why it doesn't have to be like that so what we
21:39
need to do is pinpoint the reason why and then fix it to get the machine to going back to what it's supposed to do
21:45
okay so what we need to do is get familiar with what those parts are now these parts are exactly the same 16
21:50
Parts doesn't M matter whether you're uber or Amazon I doubt we've got anyone from Uber or Amazon listening but it doesn't matter whether you're that size
21:57
or whether you're a one person band operating on your own or if you're running a 10 million construction
22:02
business it's all they are the same 16 parts so what we need to do is get familiar with uh what these parts are
22:08
for your business as in how they measure and then get familiar with how you spot the parts that aren't working properly
22:13
so that you can do something about it and a lot Tom before before before you go on I just I just I just want to make
22:18
a comment say we're not advocating for businesses to be moneya laundering machines no no absolutely not idea yeah
22:26
maybe maybe we'll change the the analogy Wasing machine to I don't know a tractor or
22:32
something um so yeah a lot of business owners firstly they don't know what these parts are um and they end up just trying to do
22:39
everything so they don't really know what the problem is in their business um so they try and do everything to just
22:46
keep uh keep putting fires out spinning all the plates and the problems don't get fixed because they're not focusing
22:51
on the right thing okay so to focus on the right thing and then fix it we've got to understand the parts and then in
22:58
and focus on the one that's not working properly because everything else is just noise so like I said if we're having
23:04
profitability or cashow issues usually it's just one or two things that aren't going quite right in the business so Focus for example um I had a client2
23:11
million pound a year Revenue marketing agency virtually nothing left in profits at the end of the day so they came to me
23:17
and they said well we just need to do more marketing more sales and I said hold on but you're doing 2 million in
23:22
Revenue but you've got virtually no profit so more Revenue isn't going to result in more profit
23:29
um and it was kind of an eye openening moment for them to to then basically go through this exercise that I'm about to
23:34
go through with you and and show them kind of what they need to be focusing on so with that in mind um what are the
23:40
parts and how do we improve them um so each like I said each part each business
23:46
is made up of the same 16 parts and each part's job is to increase one of these three areas so Revenue profit cash flow
23:53
revenue is what you sell profit what you sell minus your expenses and then cash flow is what's actually left at the end of the day for the business owner okay
23:59
so if we've got um here's an example a question I get very often is difference between profit and cash flow we made
24:05
100K last year but we've got nowhere near that in the bank what's going on so here's an example of of just how that
24:11
works so let's say we had 50k of of Revenue we sold 50k worth of stuff 30k
24:17
of costs um which means our profit is 20K okay these these numbers under where
24:22
it says taxes debt payments owner draws they should actually be under cash flow so apology there that's a that's a little error um but we left with 20K in
24:29
profit but then what happened after that is that we had uh taxes from last year that we had to pay uh we had debt
24:35
repayments of 3K and then the owner takes out 6K and then one of our customers decides not to pay so the end
24:41
result is that yeah our profit was 20K but the amount we're left with is is neg is minus three okay so that cash has to
24:48
come from somewhere and so my point here is that increase in cash flow is more
24:53
important than increasing profit and increasing profit is more important than increasing Revenue okay but you inre all
24:58
three of those numbers Revenue profit Cash Flow by focusing on the 16 drivers of Revenue profit and cash flow so what
25:05
are they here they are so like I said doesn't matter what your business is uh you're these these 16 parts are exactly
25:12
the same so starting with Revenue so we start with leads so this is the number of people that Express an interest in
25:18
your in your product or your service obviously if that number is zero then how can you possibly sell anything so
25:23
this is where it all starts next one conversion ratees the number of those leads that convert to clients
25:29
as a percentage um so obviously the higher this number the the more sales
25:35
you're going to make if this is zero you make no sales retention rate number of clients that we retain or that come back
25:41
each year uh purchase frequency rate the number of times each client purchases within a year average transaction value
25:48
the average value of each transaction obviously the goal with all of these drivers is to make them as high as possible but if we can see that one of
25:53
them is is much lower than where it should be then that's how we work out what we need to be focusing on
25:59
um profit drivers so obviously one of the profit drivers is revenue and then we have our costs so we take off the cost of good sold which is the the cost
26:06
incurred in actually delivering the the product or service the marketing expenses the payroll
26:12
expenses um the overhead expenses and then we generally like to see those
26:17
numbers measured as a percentage of Revenue because it allows you to compare the periods much more e much easier so
26:22
if you had payroll if say payroll was 10% this month and it was uh 12% last
26:27
month um we probably wouldn't see a difference that big over one month to the next but let's say it was uh eight
26:33
8% last year and 12% this year then we can highlight that something's changed and understanding why it's changed and
26:38
Shining a spotlight on is a really valuable exercise for business owners to do and then we have other income and
26:44
other expenses so anything that's kind of non-core not part of the main business activity that the business does
26:49
that would fall into this part so that gives you your profit and then we have cash flow so Day sales outstanding this
26:56
is how long it takes you to get paid by your customers so we want this number to be as short as possible it means that
27:01
our customers are paying us faster so this is a really often a really quick win uh if you're struggling with cash
27:06
flow often there's a problem with credit control and you're not getting paid um if you can get your customers to pay you
27:12
faster this is often a really good way to do it uh days inventory outstanding this isn't applicable to all businesses
27:17
only if you only if you actually hold inventory but the lower this number is the better for the business because it means your cash isn't tied up in your
27:24
inventory which means you can use it for other things um they sales or purch of assets so purchasing assets or selling
27:31
assets if you if you buy an asset it's an asset for the business but it decreases cash flow so we want to make
27:36
sure that we're only acquiring assets that are going to have a positive impact on the business or they going to have a positive return and then on the other
27:43
hand if you sell an asset um that raises cash for the business uh days payable outstanding how long it takes to pay
27:49
your suppliers so we want this number to be as long as possible without annoying them okay the longer we can take to pay
27:55
our suppliers the more we hold on to the cash flow for and then we can use it for other things in the business uh using or
28:01
paying down debt um so debt will debt will improve cash flow so if we need cash often borrowing it is a good way to
28:07
get it however we do want to be careful with debt and and make sure that we're only taking on debt where it's going to be used for something that's going to
28:14
have a positive return um owner or investment draws so we want this number to be as high as
28:20
possible we want business owners to be able to take as much as they can from the business but remember that when you take cash from the business you're you
28:25
could be starving the business of cash so we want to make sure that we're taking as much out as we can without without starving the business on the
28:31
other hand if you put money in then that's a cash injection for the business the cash flow goes up for the business okay so all parts of of all 16 of these
28:39
parts affect the business um just as much as the other one okay
28:45
so those are the 16 Parts by the way if you weren't taking notes don't worry we're going to send you send you out a list of of those things later um but now
28:53
we know what drives the most important numbers of any business so we know how to track them or or rather we now need
28:59
to track them and focus on the ones that need to be improved or work out which ones need to be improved and then focus
29:05
on those and those are going to be the ones that are going to have the largest impact on profits and cash flow so let's say for example we we're running a
29:11
Professional Services business and all of our clients leave after three months well we may not have a marketing or a sales problem we might have a client
29:17
retention problem and so that would be what we focus on okay and the point of a business as I've as I've been through
29:22
before is to make money or cash that's why it exists okay so when we have a business that generates cash that cash
29:29
by definition increases the value of the business because it's one of those key drivers that grae talked about earlier
29:35
and we can use that cash to invest in those risk areas that Graham highlighted to increase the value of the business
29:41
reduce the risk and make it a more enjoyable thing to run and although uh
29:46
making money is the point it's not necessarily easy to do and it's not necessarily easy to do because most business owners are not necessarily
29:53
numbers people and money and and cash flow and all these things and those 16 drivers that I just went through are all
29:58
numbers um and the thought of looking at numbers like that can be quite triggering for a lot of business owners
30:05
or lot of the ones I speak to anyway and most business owners understand that they need to know their numbers but they're not exactly excited about
30:11
pouring over the data to understand these numbers understanding the 16 drivers and determining which ones need
30:16
improving okay um but I am and I know grae is and that's pretty much all I do
30:21
um gra from a slightly different angle um but what what I do is I help my clients build um
30:28
businesses that that remain healthy and produce consistent positive uh cash flow profits and then Graham helps with the
30:35
business valuation aspect of that and I've build a process around helping business owners do exactly that and this
30:40
is how the process works and you can you can just copy this um step by
30:46
step so the first step I tend to meet with my clients every month so if you're
30:51
not meeting me then at least schedule a meeting with yourself to to to get this to get this done um the very first
30:57
meeting will set Target so let's go let's go back to the the goal of selling the business now I'm
31:02
going to overly simplify this uh despite what grahe said about not being able to simplify in this way but for the purpose
31:09
of this we we sort of have to so let's say we want to sell the business in five years for a million pounds to get to a business that is generating that is
31:15
worth a million pounds we need to um we need to be making at least 300K in profits let's say um so we need to be
31:22
hitting 300K in profits by year five or ideally before that by year three or four um and so we reverse engineer that
31:29
back to today and create a plan of what we need to do and break it down into those 16 drivers that I talked about
31:35
earlier okay so at the end of that first call or that first um review you're going to know exactly what you're aiming
31:41
for in terms of Revenue profits and cash flow and we want these targets to be aggressive but they have to be realistic
31:46
okay and then each month uh we'll look at the numbers and we'll uh determine how determine how well the business is
31:53
performing so we'll look at what's happened and we'll paint a picture of what's going on okay then we will for
31:58
where it looks like you're heading in terms of Revenue profit and cash flow for the rest of the year okay so that way we can take steps now to prevent any
32:05
issues in the future so we can foresee any problems that might be coming up with cash flow or whatever and we can uh
32:11
and we'll do that before the before the before the meeting okay um so what you're going to have is a very clear
32:16
picture of where you've been and what and where you're going next okay so you're going to know where you are in relation to your targets at any given
32:23
point in time Clarity uh what we'll then do is have a scorecard red Amber green
32:28
scorecard so that you know exactly what's working and not working the business so we've got the information from the previous step so Clarity on the
32:34
numbers and then step two is understanding what's working and not working in a very simple way red Amber green and then this is where the whole
32:41
process Comes Alive what we'll do um is we'll create a
32:47
plan so if you're not on track to hitting your targets we will create a plan to get you back on track to hitting
32:52
your targets if you're on track then we'll create a plan for keeping you on track and instead of focusing on what uh
32:57
guessing what to focus on I would actually tell you what to focus on if we work together and at the end of the call you're going to have a very precise
33:03
action plan for you and for your team okay and the only thing left to do from then is going to be to
33:08
execute and the plan will be detailed and specific so you're going to know exactly what to do during the month um
33:14
and you know how to what you need to do to actually execute the plan and then if you run into any roadblocks or questions then I'm just going to be an email or or
33:21
a phone call away so you'll have unlimited access to me so I'll be your your financial guide essentially and
33:27
then it's a case of just repeating that process um and that's pretty much it and the whole point of this is so that you
33:32
can go from owning a stressful job that doesn't really have much value to owning a successful business that generates consistent positive cash flow that
33:39
builds the value of the business that and and something that you can one day sell Tom I mean if I can just just add
33:46
in there I think I think you know to the summary of a lot of that is it all comes
33:51
down to are you working in the business or are you working on the business and a lot of the stuff is quite habitual so
33:58
that process that you laid out there for business owners is actually about taking a step back and looking from the outside
34:04
in in terms of where do you want to go with your business what is your objective um and I think a lot of
34:11
business owners kind of find it quite surprising because there's no rocket science in it it's actually about discipline and you know looking from the
34:18
outside in rather than just being inside the business all the time and that framework just allows business owners to
34:24
do that in a structured and repeatable way and once that mindset set a lot of
34:30
the other things in the business which were stressful and problematic before kind of fall into place um it's a bit
34:35
like if you're training to improve your Fitness you know when you get into the habit of going to the gym three or four
34:40
times a week Suddenly It's not a problem anymore and I think you know that's really the power of that sort of
34:46
framework absolutely yeah thanks for adding that gr so that's it in terms of
34:51
uh the the stuff that we wanted to go through now in terms of next steps and a few bits and pieces that we want to give
34:57
you so firstly um I'm offering a complimentary 30 minute call with any
35:03
any of you who are interested anybody who would like to uh have a chat about kind of where you're at with your business where you're trying to go any
35:09
of the roadblocks that are stopping you getting there and then we can brainstorm any any potential ways to help you
35:15
overcome those um the 16 drivers of the business that I went through earlier um
35:20
going to give that to you all in a report it's going to break down each area and explain what each area does or what it means and then how to work it
35:27
out for your business um and then an Express business valuation so this is
35:32
going to give you an idea of kind of what your business is worth at the moment um and then what you can do is you can in your mind work out how far
35:38
away that is from where you're trying to go and if you don't really know where you're trying to go then perhaps is a good time to set a goal and then and
35:45
then combine that with what you get back from the business valuation and then you can highlight the eras that you need to
35:50
potentially work on and then an exit exit Readiness scorecard um so this is a
35:55
a questionnaire that you'll go through to basic basically just um highlight how ready you are you and your business are
36:02
for for an exit um so if you're interested in all of that then you can just scan the QR
36:08
code which is up on the up on the slide or visit the website which is there Sy CFOs
36:14
solutions. um schedule that call and then what I'll do is I'll send you the report the business valuation and the
36:19
exit screening scorecard before the call that we have so that you can do those things and then we can discuss them on
36:25
the call together and I will pause there gra anything to add and if not we can open
36:30
up for some Q&A I think yeah I mean we'd obviously like to open the floor up for some questions I see um there's a
36:36
question that's come through around um from from grahe not not me Al be talking
36:42
to myself but basically saying this is management accounting setting of budgets the question is how does a business know
36:47
that it's creating value for its clients um that it's operating in the right Market Etc and I think gr that's a
36:55
that's an absolutely great question because you know we are talking about
37:00
process we're talking about accounting but at the end of the day it comes down to are you adding value to your clients
37:07
so yes we focused on some of those pieces I think that feedback loop with your clients I mean that's one of the
37:13
systems and the processes that any business needs to have is absolutely critical um some of that is are you
37:21
talking to your clients um you know I think some of the Practical tools things like Google reviews trust pilot reviews
37:27
is actually asking your clients what do they think what's working what's not you you can't bury your head in the sand and
37:33
just assume um and I think it's really really important is as much as you do financial review reviews whether it's
37:40
once a quarter whether it's once a year is actually to have regular customer check-ins ask them for feedback what's
37:48
working what's not I know too many business owners they just kind of get going and they forget about it you know
37:53
the people that have made them get to where they are and then they ignore the customers and they kind of abstract and
37:59
they think oh it's just a money-making machine you absolutely critical is you you got to do that you got to do things
38:05
like regular market research go and see what your competitors are doing observe the trends so there's no singular answer
38:12
to that but um those are things that that you have to do um you know don't
38:18
really want to add anything to that Tom so just to be clear the question was
38:24
how do you know if you're adding value to your clients yeah I would ask them
38:29
that I would ask them and then I would also pay attention to what's happening if you remember those 16 drivers that we
38:35
went through pay attention to H to what's happening at the beginning so um in terms of if you're talking about are
38:41
you providing value to your existing clients then how about we look at the uh retention rate of clients and the rep
38:46
repeat purchase rate if you have clients that are sticking with you for a long time then it's an indication that yeah you are providing value to them um on
38:54
the other hand if you can't if you can't bring on enough clients or you can't bring on clients then perhaps it's an indication that either your marketing
39:01
isn't isn't quite hitting the right points with your potential clients um or you've got a sales problem or maybe yeah
39:08
the value proposition isn't quite there so that's that's kind of the part of this process that I would pay attention to if you're wondering whether you're
39:14
adding value to your clients but also I would I would ask them yeah cool there's another question
39:20
that's come through from Charles is how how does a Botique m&a business assess its place uh in this space so I'm I'm
39:28
not quite sure 100% understand the question but um so
39:33
I'm going to hand it over to you Tom you go first and then then I'll take a stab I'll think about it can you repeat the
39:39
question how does a boutique m&a business assess its place in the SMB or
39:44
the space uh yeah I'm not sure exactly what
39:49
that's asking uh but I can have a go so I would say I would say it's a case of working
39:55
out who your part of the market you're serving so if you're m&a serving the SMB
40:01
are you serving uh 5 to 15 million pound Revenue businesses what exactly you
40:07
doing for them are you helping them merge uh merge with other businesses like theirs or you helping them sell um
40:15
I don't know if that adds anything at all um but I think it's just a case of getting clear on exactly what you're what you're doing and for who and making
40:21
sure that your marketing messaging communicates that and not trying to be all things to all people yeah I think I
40:27
think I mean maybe I can just add a comment to that is I think you know there's an underserved part of the market I think when it comes to to m&a
40:33
and the sort of 2 million pound to let's call a 10 million pound space you know it's too small for the sort of traditional private Equity Corporate
40:41
Finance houses and and and maybe too big for some of the sort of smaller business broker space um and I think a lot of the
40:48
time in terms of let's call it Boutique m&a in the space is actually more around it's it's about business broking and
40:54
it's more about being potentially a sell side or buy side advis it to your clients so you know I think um you know
41:00
that's just a perspective on on that question and yeah I mean we can take that offline Charles if if if if there's
41:06
any more detail around that um there's another question from Cam and cam says typically how much additional value do
41:13
IP and Trade Secrets add for a service business that doesn't have any specific
41:19
product or software IP I think maybe I'll take a stab at that first and Tom you can you can jump in is I kind of
41:26
look at this quite simply um IP and branding in itself does not have any
41:33
value it might sound like a controversial statement but it has value in so far is it enables a business to
41:40
create additional profits and cash flow I hear this all the time with smaller businesses I've built a great brand I've
41:47
got 30,000 um you know Instagram followers
41:52
um but unless you can find a way to convert those followers and the brand and the IP into actual revenues and
41:59
profits it's got very little value um and typically when we talk about the Goodwill or the brand value of a
42:06
business you value the business on a cash flow basis and then you take away
42:11
the actual value of the fixed assets and any liabilities and that difference is
42:16
what's often called the Goodwill or the the IP value um but it's it's how much
42:22
does it add to extra profits at the end of the day or extra cash profits at the end of the day
42:30
Tom anything to add um I no I think I think I think that was good I think I would just add that the purpose of
42:36
protecting your IP would be that if you have built up a business that is producing really good cash flow really
42:42
good profits then the purpose of protecting it would be to to protect the clients that you've got and to protect
42:47
the the brand that you've got yeah yeah I think yeah also importantly there I mean
42:54
I think it's important to kind of get the right sort of um you know legal legal protection and the legal advice you know I think I think
43:01
Craig Kelly from aquab bridge law is is is on the is on the call I mean he would be a great guy to reach out for instance
43:06
if you want any legal legal support in that space but um I think there's one final question yeah and Tom I talks to
43:13
the 16 points so I'm going to I'm going to let you answer it and it's an asks in your experience is it easier or harder
43:19
to succeed in challenging Economic Times with the 16
43:24
points uh so I think it's naturally probably harder to succeed in tough
43:31
Economic Times but uh the the ones who can make it work during those times are
43:37
going to be the ones who uh reap the highest rewards um and then as for the 16 drivers um I I'm not sure how the
43:43
economic Times relates to the 16 drivers uh particularly um in in the question um
43:49
but I would say that whatever stage you're at whatever stage we're at in the cycle then getting into the habit of
43:54
following that process that I went through so reviewing calculating those numbers the 16 drivers for your business
43:59
and then reviewing them every month is a really good exercise to get into the habit of doing and then more importantly
44:05
once you know the numbers okay what do you do next focusing on the right things yeah I mean I think I think I'll make
44:10
one point there is is is is is is Summer Bodies are built in winter so I think having the discipline to actually follow
44:17
through with those even in tough times it sets you up for you know when the cycle turns um so it's probably more
44:24
important to maintain the discipline of going through those 16 steps in tough times I think sometimes when when things
44:30
are going well people kind of tend to forget about them um but um yeah I mean
44:36
that's that's that's another way of looking at it I think it's time for one more question before we need to wrap up and and it's a question from Piers who
44:43
says there are plenty of brands that have sold for significant multiples despite not being profitable our
44:50
consumer Brands value differently on a whole um so you know I think p it's a it's it's a
44:58
great question um and we get it a lot I think it's very similar to the question around IP at the end of the day is what
45:05
is the reason that those brands are being acquired for by hinin as the
45:11
example that you used there is I think there's different ways of looking at often those are sort of strategic
45:17
Acquisitions um sometimes the big Brands like that will make those Acquisitions
45:22
because they see this as a potential young upstart brand and they want to knock out the competition um another
45:29
example might be when you know Facebook acquired Instagram many years ago you
45:34
know they they kind of were trans spotter so there's a variety of different reasons so so that might be
45:40
more of a strategic acquisition but also I think has it got a potential to add
45:46
profits so there may be synergies down the line in terms of reaching a particular target market or particular
45:51
audience cross- selling to them there's a bunch of different reasons so yes it does happen
45:57
um and each of those cases is is is is quite different and quite unique but you know pe's happy to take that offline as
46:04
well and have a chat around that Tom should we wrap up yeah um yeah
46:11
perfect let's let's wrap it up so yeah thank you everyone for joining so if you if you do want to take this conversation further you've got um well you've got
