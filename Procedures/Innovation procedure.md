### Quantifying innovation
Example: Changing greeting words used for a retail shop
Before change:
1. Determine how many people came in the door before the innovation was put into place
2. Determine how many people purchased product and the dollar value of those products
After the change
3. Count the number of people who came in the door after you change the words
4. Count the number of people who purchased something
5. Determine the average unit value of the sales
6. Determine what the improvement netted as a result.
